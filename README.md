What is this library?

## Description

This library is something I've been thinking about for a while now. Building a set of basic machine learning algorithms that can be used for learning purposes. 

Right now I plan on doing:

1. Supervised Learning
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines

2. Statistical classifications
* K - Nearest Neighbor
* Gradient Descent

3. Unsupervised Learning
* K-means Clustering
* Expectation-maximization
